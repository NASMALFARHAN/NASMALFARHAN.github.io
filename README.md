# ABOUT ME

Myself Nasmal farhan P A. Iam currently pursuing my final year B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from MES College of Engineering.

I am a dedicated person with a family of five. I enjoy reading, and the knowledge and perspective that my reading gives me has strengthened my teaching skills and presentation abilities. I have been successful at raising a family, and I attribute this success to my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. This flexibility will help me in the classroom, where there are many different personalities and learning styles

  + + ### MY FAB LAB DAIRIES

Its always interesting to learn something new.Especially something that is revolutionary and has a promising future. The crash course in FABLAB would guide anyone into fascinating world of creativity.


MESCE Fab Lab is one of the 20 mini fablab in Kerala where the students have the oppurtunity to explore FAB world.

Recently, our college was selected among 20 others in kerala where a fabrication lab (FABLAB) was to be setup. It gives me great pleasure to document and share my FABLAB experiences with you using this platform.

+ + ### DAY ONE (GLIMPSES OF REALISATION)

Our trainer Mr.Jaseel was successful in explaining the main theme of the entire programme.He made as aware about the future scopes of FAB and was able to convince as how the same can influence the future world.

### fablab
To put it very simply, fab lab is a mini factory of sorts where anyone can work on an idea and build a prototype, which would then help to figure out potential market for the product.It has wide variety of machines to make thing possible as we wish.Anything can be rebuild with a short span without much complicated manufacturing procedures.

 ### Precision cutter
A CNC Engraving machine is the art of cutting or carving grooves
or characters into a surface. The more common forms are hand eng raving, mechanical engraving (pantographs, computer engravers, CNC engraving, etc.) and a variety of photographic and chemical etching processes.Rotary Engraving, or CNC Routing, is done with a rotating tool or cutter in a motorized spindle. The process is similar to routing and is used to produce cuts of specified widths and depths in a wide variety of materials.

### Drillers
In rock drilling, the hole is usually not made through a circular cutting motion, though the bit is usually rotated. Instead, the hole is usually made by hammering a drill bit into the hole with quickly repeated short movements. The hammering action can be pe rformed from outside of the hole (top-hammer drill) or within the hole (down-the-hole drill, DTH). Drills used for horizontal drill ing are called drifter drills.

### Laser cutter
Laser cutting is a precise method of cutting a design from a given material using a CAD file to guide it. There are three main types of lasers used in the industry: CO2 lasers Nd and Nd-YAG. We use CO 2 machines. This involves firing a laser which cuts by melting, burning or vaporizing your material. You can achieve a really fine level of cutting detail on with a wide variety of materials. Bare in mind that CO 2 lasers can’t cut metals and hard materials, they can however engrave them

### Milling machine


The milling machines are also known as the multi-tasking machines (MTMs) which are multi-purpose machines capable of milling and tu rning the materials as well. The milling machine has got the cutt er installed up on it which helps in removing the material from t he surface of the work piece. When the material gets cooled down then it is removed from the milling machine.

### 3D Printers
3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file.The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additi ve process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventu al object

### Moulding machine


Injection molding machine molds can be fastened in either a horizo ntal or vertical position. The majority of machines are horizontal ly oriented, but vertical machines are used in some niche applicat ions such as insert molding, allowing the machine to take advantage of gravity. Some vertical machines also don’t require the mold to be fastened. There are many ways to fasten the tools to the platens , the most common being manual clamps (both halves are bolted to t he platens); however hydraulic clamps (chocks are used to hold the tool in place) and magnetic clamps are also used

### Mini furnaces


Furnaces feature rugged ceramic tops and bottoms with durable alum inum alloy sides. As a result, they are 20 to 25 percent lighter t han comparable ceramic-shell furnaces and 40 to 45 percent lighter than aluminum-frame furnaces. This reduction in furnace weight is a particularly important consideration in hand pouring operations . Their removable front and back inspection and access panels make Mini-Melt™ Furnaces easier to maintain and cost less to repair th an shell furnaces and aluminum frame furnaces. These furnaces ha ve a strong, durable construction for long furnace life. They al so operate at frequencies from 3,000 to 10,000 hertz with maxim um power utilization
